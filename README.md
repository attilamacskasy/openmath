# openmath
We’re building fun AI-assisted tools with my boys to make learning math more exciting. This repository contains helpers and mini-apps designed to help elementary school students practice math in a playful way.

## Dual Purpose
- Support kids in exploring core math concepts—starting with multiplication—through approachable console experiences like the `multiplication-table-app`.
- Pilot spec-driven development with lightweight documentation (`AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `docs/requirements.md`, `docs/design.md`, `docs/tasks.md`) so we can experiment with repeatable workflows for future projects.
