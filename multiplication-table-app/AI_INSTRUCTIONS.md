# AI Contribution Guidelines

- Keep code changes small, well-scoped, and accompanied by minimal inline comments only when clarification is necessary.
- Prefer pure Python standard library solutions unless additional packages are explicitly requested in `requirements.txt`.
- Maintain ASCII output for console interactions to ensure cross-platform consistency.
- When modifying `src/` files, run `python src/main.py` to validate behavior before handing work back to the user.
- Update the specification documents in `docs/` whenever requirements, design decisions, or task plans change.
